#### how to resume
- the person_schema.json is a schema for the yml file, you can turn on autocomplete in ij, likely eclipse too
- get rust, rustup works on windoze too with a visual studio compiler dowlnload, on mac and linux its super easy, goog up rust install <os>
- goof around with the html and md templates, make them pretty
- fill out the resume monster
- just cargo run the project or run it in the ide, the resume.[md|html] files are the output.
