>Senior Developer, real time market risk exposure 2016 - present
>>> - Optimized the risk engine to be able to achieve ~10x throughput through data partitioning and parallel computation.
>>> - Implemented dynamic resource provisioning using kubernetes and built out a REST backend to control those interactions via a React/js front end.
>>> - Improved resiliency by migrating the core messaging system from point to point proprietary technology to Kafka.
>>> - Decomposed parts of a SOA system into a micro-services based system, improving both granularity of failure and time to market for new services.
>>> - Operationally hardened the data ingest pipeline by adding REST based technologies to improve real time telemetry gathering and observability of active services.
>>> - Implemented and maintained support for a wide variety of wire protocols FIX, JSON, Avro, SOUP/tcp, various proprietary binary formats.


>Manager, AWS based BI 2015 - 2016
>>> - Managed seven direct reports, acted as scrum master for the team, as well as the primary business liaison.
>>> - Implemented AWS deployed ETL pipelines, data warehouse, and reporting solutions with AWS Redshift, Aurora, S3, EC2 and Pentaho tooling.
>>> - Applied a consistent and transparent development cycle, balancing the needs of various stakeholders to deliver projects on time.


>Developer, Compliance reporting 2012 - 2016
>>> - Maintained and improved a legacy reporting/ETL system, with strict delivery timing and data quality SLAs.
>>> - Applied ~7x throughput improvement through data structure optimization, while improving the quality of output.
>>> - Clean room re-implementation of OATS, vastly improved mean time between failure and overall throughput.
>>> - Matured deployment pipeline from homegrown rsync based tooling to rpm.
>>> - Implemented a database backed webapp for configuration management, validating sensitive configurations, reducing mean time between failure due to configuration oversights.
