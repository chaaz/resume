    <p>Senior Developer, real time market risk exposure</p>
    <blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>Optimized the risk engine to be able to achieve ~10x throughput through data partitioning and parallel
                computation.
            </li>
            
            <li>Implemented dynamic resource provisioning using kubernetes and built out a REST backend to control those interactions via a React/js front end.</li>

            <li>Improved resiliency by migrating the core messaging system from point to point proprietary technology to
                Kafka.
            </li>
            
            <li>Decomposed parts of a SOA system into a micro-services based system, improving both granularity of failure and time to market for new services.</li>

            <li>Operationally hardened the data ingest pipeline by adding REST based technologies to improve real time
                telemetry gathering and observability of active services.
            </li>
            
            <li>Implemented and maintained support for a wide variety of wire protocols FIX, JSON, Avro, SOUP/tcp, various proprietary binary formats.</li>

            <li>Implemented AWS deployed ETL pipelines, data warehouse, and reporting solutions with AWS Redshift, Aurora, S3, EC2 and Pentaho tooling.</li>
            
            <li>Applied a consistent and transparent development cycle, balancing the needs of various stakeholders to deliver projects on time.</li>

    <p>Developer, Compliance reporting</p>
    <blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintained and improved a legacy reporting/ETL system, with strict delivery timing and data quality
                SLAs.
            </li>

            <li>Applied ~7x throughput improvement through data structure optimization, while improving the quality of
                output.
            </li>
            
            <li>Clean room re-implementation of OATS, vastly improved mean time between failure and overall throughput.</li>
            
            <li>Matured deployment pipeline from homegrown rsync based tooling to rpm.</li>

            <li>Implemented a database backed webapp for configuration management, validating sensitive configurations,
                reducing mean time between failure due to configuration oversights.
            </li>
